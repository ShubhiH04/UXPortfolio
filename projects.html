            <h3>InterpretAid</h3>
            <p>A Figma app design I worked on of an AI-enhanced medical communication tool, with the goal to encompass patients who face challenges understanding medical terminology during healthcare interactions, such as ESL-Speakers, elderly patients with cognitive challenges, patients with hearing impairments, etc.</p>

            <h3>MarketMate</h3>
            <p>A website design that I worked on of a grocery shopping aid, where users can search for items through the Open Food Facts API and get a look at the item's dietary details, favorite any item they want, and create/manage their own shopping lists. Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Firebase.</p>

            <h3>Revivo</h3>
            <p>A Figma app design I worked on of a tool centered around the Washington's Right to Repair Bill to help mitigate Electronic Waste by providing UW students an application that helps them make informed decisions about how to proceed with their damages devices. Users can input their desired budget range, select the route they want to take (Repair, Used Device Replacement, or Upgraded Device Replacement), and schedule appointments and keep track of their devices. </p>

            <h3>When AI Lies With Confidence</h3>
            <p>My capstone project where my team and I researched how LLMs can relay misinformation with confidence, speficially with Women's Reproductive Health, thus making the response persuasive to the user. I was the sole developer in this team, utilizing Colab Notebook to work in Python and analyze LLM response datasets, generate LLM responses via LangChain, create the scoring systems for Confidence and Accuracy, and train a RandomForestClassifier machine learning model to analyze and predict confidence and accuracy labels. I also web scraped NIH (National Institute of Health) to check for accuracy. I was also response for developing a Chrome Extension to take this trained model and deploy it to be used as an LLM scanner. The tools used were HTML, JavaScript, and Flask API.</p>
